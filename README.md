Description
Develop a website which facilitates video conferencing by implementing WebRtc architecture(Peer to Peer)
Some necessary features are:-

When a user visits the home page he/she should get two options, to create a room or to join a room (similar to Zoom)
Once he/she joins the created room he/she should get the room_id to share with people who can than join the room using this room_id
The room should also provide a feature for text chat messages
This text chat should be dynamic(We need not refresh page for updating with new chats)
The space of chat room should be on left/right side of the web page and preferably there should be a option to hide it (similar to Google meets)
